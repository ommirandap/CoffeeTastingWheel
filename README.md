### SCAA Interactive Tasting Wheel 

This project is an online and interactive version of the renewed Coffee Tasting Wheel, released by the SCAA on 01/19/2016.
After more than 20 years one of the tools most used by coffee enthusiasts and proffesionals, finally receives an update.

I include an spanish translated version too (powered by Google translate and wikipedia for more accurated terms).
Cheers!
